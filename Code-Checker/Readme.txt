This version is not much advance.
I got motivation to do this my lab exam.

only i have to write function in main.cpp and change line 33 as per function and some minor changes  for test-cases.

and put input with comma sign in input.txt
for example:= {2,5,67,89}

rest in output put it with space sign in output.txt
for example:= {4 10 134 178 }

it's slight space-sensitive as per run.txt and output.txt both are trailing sensitive.

to run it write make in terminal oviously in makefile in that directory.
