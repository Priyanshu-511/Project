Basic Output Checker:

This version is not very advanced.
I got the motivation to create this from my lab exam.

I only need to write the function in main.cpp and modify line 33 according to the function, along with some minor changes for the test cases.

Input should be placed in input.txt with commas separating the values, for example: {2,5,67,89}.

The output should be placed in output.txt with spaces separating the values, for example: {4 10 134 178 }.

It is slightly case-sensitive as both run.txt and output.txt are trailing sensitive.

To run it, type make in the terminal, obviously with the Makefile in that directory.
