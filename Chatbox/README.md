# 🤖 Chatbot using Together.ai API

This project is a simple chatbot server built with **Node.js** and **Express**. Instead of using the paid OpenAI ChatGPT API, it utilizes the free **Together.ai** API to generate responses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure to install the required packages:

```bash

💡 Note
Since the official ChatGPT API is paid, this project uses the Together.ai API — a free alternative that provides access to powerful language models.

🧪 Example Usage
You can send POST requests to your server endpoint with user input, and the server will respond with AI-generated replies.

📁 Environment Variables
Make sure to create a .env file in the root directory and include your Together.ai API key like this:
