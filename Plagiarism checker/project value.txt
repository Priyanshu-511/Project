As part of a course project, I am very grateful to Prof. Ashutosh Kumar Gupta for giving us a project that takes our learning to a whole new level.

This project has allowed us to explore important concepts in depth and understand the practical implications of our studies.

Additionally, we have gained valuable skills in research and critical thinking that will benefit us in our future careers.

Overall, this experience has been enriching and has enhanced our appreciation for the subject matter.
